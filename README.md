# FoCoPop (Complete project link https://leungk712.github.io/FoCoPop/)

Hello! Welcome to FoCo Pop! What inspired me to create this website was based on Colt Steele's Bootstrap 4 section in his Web Developer course. I liked the design that he had for his Museum of Candy and wanted to take it a bit further and design a webpage for a fake popsicle shop based in Fort Collins, Colorado. The menu is seasonal with a variety of unique flavors. 

This is a Bootstrap 4 based theme. Currently (as of 5/1/2019), I am working on an ordering page that will include HTML forms alongside Javascript that will produce a dynamic message once a customer has placed their order. 

Issues that I have come across is the scrolling method. I have tried using CSS and JavaScript to practice a smooth scrolling effect but the scrolls don't exactly align. I am hoping in the future I can have this resolved. Other issues include trying to figure out how to add JavaScript to the webpage. As a new developer I am currently trying to figure out ways to implement and practice my JS skills without going overboard and adding so many effects to the webpage that would make the user experience a bit too much. 

Stay tuned!

Hello! Few updates. I am currently in the process of refactoring my code to make sure I'm not repeating myself. One challenge is making sure that I continue to build good habits in properly naming my classes and ids so if I'm working on a project with other developers that I properly communicate what they're looking at (HTML, CSS, JS). 

I have added the order form page. It's using HTML and CSS currently. I plan to incorporate JavaScript into by showcasing an overlay receipt box that summarizes their order. This will allow me to continue to learn how to manipulate the DOM and add dynamics to my page.

Ran an audit using Google Lighthouse. One thing I need to improve upon is proper image sizing to optimize loading performance and speed. Will continue to use Google Chrome Developer Tools.
